## Usage

To use this application. Just follow the link to the deployed application. If this is your first time visiting this application, Welcome!. You will need to select signup instead of login, to create a username and password. From there you can view all blog posts on the homepage, or you can visit your dashboard to create new posts of your own. If you find something interesting, don't be shy, leave a comment. You can also update and delete your own post if the need should arise. I hope you enjoy!
